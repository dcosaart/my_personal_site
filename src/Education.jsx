                    <p>As of summer 2024, I am going into my junior year at Wichita State.  Two more years under my belt and two more to
                        go.  I started in August 2022 and will graduate in May 2026 with a Computer Science degree.
                        As of right now, I have a 3.87 cumulative GPA and made the dean&apos;s honor roll for each
                        semester of college.</p>

                <p>
                    In my personal experience, Wichita State University was the best choice for me.  Sure it has its
                    ups and downs, but every college will.  I didn&apos;t know much or have much confidence in picking where I wanted to go to
                    college, but I knew that I wanted to set myself up in the best possible place once I graduate.  Being in a big city compared
                    to a small one grants you many more opportunities that are yours for the taking.  This has inspired me to go all in on my
                    computer science career because Wichita and Wichita State University have opened me up to all the possibilities that could
                    come through life.  When I was in small-town Kansas, I was not able to see my potential yet, now I do.

                    As of June 24, 2024, The course has taught me the logic, algorithms, and data structures needed to construct an
                    artificial intelligence that behaves like a human.  With still more to come, this class has served me greatly in my
                    curiosity for AI.

                    the essentials of programming in the Python language. Topics include object-oriented programming, Data Structures, and
                    applications of different libraries.  Moreover, I created my Spotify API project for the class.  Since taking the course,
                    Python has been my main language of choice.

                    Like Harvard, companies and other universities offer online classes through EdX.  This <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/java/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-object-oriented-programming-with-java-i-foundations-and-syntax-basics" target="_blank">Java course</a> was
                    offered by Georgia Tech, which has its own <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/gtx" target="_blank">course series</a>.
                    It taught me the essentials of programming objects and classes through Java.  In summary, this course taught me the
                    syntax of different methods I knew in other languages.

                        and I stick to that every day.  Being in the fraternity allowed me to grow bonds with some brothers, which will never fade.
                        Membership brought me the vision I have for myself, and the confidence to take action too.

                        the fraternity house.  I hold cleanings whenever possible, repair broken equipment, and lead projects to further
                        strengthen and improve the house.  For these next two years, I will run for other positions, so I will keep
                        y&apos;all updated when the time comes.  Additionally, I have raised 1000 dollars for ALS through the Iron Phi
